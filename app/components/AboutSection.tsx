          I&apos;m a Full Stack Software Engineer with vast experience building high-impact products across fintech, health tech, e-scheduling, and fashion commerce. As a full-stack developer, I specialize in JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Kotlin, with a growing interest in backend architecture, AI, and immersive technologies like AR/VR.

        <p>
          Throughout my career, I&apos;ve led multiple engineering teams and played a key role in scaling products and businesses — including helping grow a company&apos;s assets under management to over $2 million. I thrive in fast-paced environments where open communication, experimentation, and mentorship are encouraged. I&apos;m passionate about solving real-world problems and sharing what I know to help others grow.

          Outside of work, you&apos;ll often find me experimenting with personal projects, making music, racing around a Go Kart track, or spending time with my kid — all of which keep me balanced and inspired.
